# wirecutter-with-feedback
A wire cutter machine with wire length measurement feedback mechanism built with Arduino and ESP32. This is a project for one of my subject in college which is Feedback and Control Systems where we have to design and build a feedback/control system.

## Requirements
- Arduino Uno R3
- ESP32
- ESP32 camera or equivalent

## Installation and Usage
1. Install Arduino IDE
2. Clone or download this repo:
```
git clone git@github.com:rhenzala/wirecutter-with-feedback.git
cd wirecutter-with-feedback
```
3. Activate virtual environment
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
4. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Make sure the ESP32 and Arduino are communicating properly via Serial communication.
